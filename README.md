# Form2Flow

Form2Flow is a workflow automation pipeline aimed at introductory teaching computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engineering courses. It allows the teaching team to abstract away GUIs or CLIs used to interface with CFD solvers, replacing them with a simple form submission.

It is built using tools in the freely-available [Google Workspace](https://developers.google.com/workspace/). 

The process for running simulations is as simple as filling in a Google Form with geometry files, simulation settings, etc., and receiving the results and logs from the completed simulation in a specified Google Drive folder. The simulations are run on the backend using a CFD solver of your choice, on a HPC system of your choice.

## Reference

The tool was presented at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting in November 2024, at a talk titled

[Form to Flow: a cloud-based workflow automation system for introductory CFD courses](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD24/Session/L31.8).
